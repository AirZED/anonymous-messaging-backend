**Backend Development Project: Anonymous Messaging Platform**

Task Description:
The project's objective is to build a secure and functional backend system where users can send anonymous messages to one another. Your implementation will be evaluated based on specific criteria to assess your proficiency in backend development. Additionally, you are required to create comprehensive documentation of your project.

Note: For easy setup, it is recommended (but not limited to) you use mongodb database.

Features to Be Built:
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Implement a user registration system that securely stores user credentials.
   - Develop an authentication mechanism for user login and session management.
   - Include password hashing and salting techniques for enhanced security.

2. User Profile Management:
   - Design and implement APIs for users to create and manage their profiles.
   - Allow users to update their display names and profile pictures.

3. Anonymous Messaging:
   - Create APIs for sending anonymous messages between registered users.
   - Implement a message routing and delivery system while maintaining anonymity.
   - Ensure messages are delivered without revealing the sender's identity.

4. Inbox and Message Management:
   - Develop APIs for users to view and manage their received anonymous messages.
   - Include features such as message filtering, sorting, and searching.

5. Anonymity and Privacy:
   - Implement measures to ensure the anonymity of users and messages throughout the backend system.
   - Apply appropriate encryption techniques to protect user identities and message content.
   - Enforce strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to user data.

6. Reporting and Moderation:
